About Dart
----------
Dart is an open-source Web programming language developed by Google. It was unveiled at the GOTO conference in Aarhus, October 10â€“12, 2011. The goal of Dart is "ultimately to replace JavaScript as the lingua franca of web development on the open web platform", but Dart currently relies exclusively on its cross-compilation to JavaScript feature in order to run in mainstream browsers. Dart is intended to address issues with JavaScript that Google engineers felt could not be solved by evolving the language, while offering better performance. Google works on Dart to help it build more complex, full-featured client-side Web applications.
